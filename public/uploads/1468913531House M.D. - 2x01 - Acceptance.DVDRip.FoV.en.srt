00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,997
It's clever, 'cause it forces
me to either deal with the
file or never sit down again.

169
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,901
Cindy Kramer.
I told her you'd see her.

170
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,303
Well, you shouldn't
have told her that.

171
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,240
She's got metastatic squamous
cell lung cancer.
Six months tops.

172
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,573
Have you even looked
at the x-ray?

173
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,169
No. Just guessing.

174
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,908
It's a new game. If I'm wrong,
she wins a stuffed bear.

175
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,510
A spot on an x-ray
doesn't necessarily mean
that she's terminal.

176
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,679
I love children.
So filled with hope.

177
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,019
It could be pneumonia.
It could be sarcoidosis.

178
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:29,926
Could be. If she didn't
already have swollen hilar
lymph nodes on the other lung.

179
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,897
Can we at least
brainstorm for other ideas?

180
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,438
(SlGHlNG)
Thank you.

181
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,838
I still think
pneumonia and sarcoidosis.

182
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,540
But, we should check
for tuberculosis

183
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,846
and definitely rule out
congestive heart failure.

184
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:56,983
Five stages of dying.

185
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,114
Exactly.

186
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,552
Personally, I think
it's all just New Age crap,

187
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,252
but from your tear-filled,
puppy dog eyes,

188
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,820
I think I've made my point.

189
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,390
Now go tell Cindy
whatever-her-name-is
that she's dying.

190
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,496
Tachycardia. Pulmonary edema.
Likely suspects?

191
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,874
The death row guy?

192
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,570
That's who you're working on
instead of Cindy?

193
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,943
God, I've got to learn
not to beat around the bush.

194
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,778
By "dying," I meant
no matter what we do.

195
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:29,378
Very, very soon
she is going to be dead.
Is that still too subtle?

196
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,053
I took an oath
to "do no harm."

197
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,217
Yeah, but it's not like
they make you
sign it or anything.

198
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,659
We cure your patient,
he goes back to death row.

199
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,492
He goes back to death row,
they kill him.

200
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,293
He stays here and we don't
treat him, he dies.

201
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,197
And I still don't treat
"Cindy Lou Who."

202
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,735
Can we get on with this?

203
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,328
Yeah, I knew I could count
on your help for your homie.

204
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,465
Exactly. I'm black.
I sympathize with guys
who grew up in the inner city,

205
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,066
kept down by The Man.

206
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,111
Makes sense to me.
FOREMAN: It's a bunch of crap!

207
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,342
You can't blame society
for the fact that you chose
to become a killer.

208
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,905
The guy's probably
a heroin addict.

209
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,713
That explains the tachycardia,
which caused the
pulmonary edema.

210
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,313
How does an inmate
on death row
get his hands on heroin?

211
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,682
Are you serious?
HOUSE: Man knows prisons.

212
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,228
When we got
a yachting question,
we'll come to you.

213
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,993
Okay, drugs it is.
Test his hair,
blood, urine, works.

214
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,470
Thanks for getting my back.

215
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,738
I thought
you seminary boys were
against the death penalty.

216
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,245
I've left the seminary.

217
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,305
Over their stance
on capital punishment?

218
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,247
I'm against the death penalty
in principle.

219
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,116
In practice, however,
watching a murderer die
causes me

220
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,121
a lot less grief
than annoying my boss.

221
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,919
We gotta check you out
before you go in.

222
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,157
CAMERON: Department of Justice
statistics show

223
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,221
that it's a racially motivated
form of punishment.

224
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:49,699
Black defendants are 10 times
more likely to get
a death sentence than whites.

225
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,794
Doesn't mean
we need to get rid
of the death penalty.

226
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,840
Just means we need
to kill more white people.

227
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,033
(GRUNTS)

228
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,769
It's okay.
You're in a hospital,
we're taking care of you.

229
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,075
Stay calm, you hear me?
Push two milligrams Ativan!

(GROANlNG)

231
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,126
Water. Water.

232
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,937
What's the differential
for being thirsty?

233
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,635
He was just
a little dehydrated.
And out of his mind.

234
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,602
We upped his saline drip.
He's fine now.

235
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,444
Blood and urine tests
came back clean, no sign
of opiates in his system.

236
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,005
Don't do that.

237
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,651
What?
You have some House theory
explaining heroin use

238
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,983
despite a negative test?
Nope.

239
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,355
Only I get to write
on the board.

240
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,488
So it's not drugs.

241
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,854
What else can cause a heart
to do wind sprints?

242
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:56,163
You got the blood work back,
anything out of the ordinary?

243
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,899
His bi-carb is low.

244
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,138
Yeah, but which column?

245
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,869
It could be the result
of the tachycardia,
or it could be the cause.

246
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,774
It's the cause.
Why,
because you want it to be?

247
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,904
Let's see how well that works
with your other patient.

248
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,140
We're just talking
semantics here.

249
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,649
We should put him
on a bi-carb drip
and send him back.

250
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:15,847
Right. Buff his numbers,
don't bother trying to figure
out the underlying cause.

251
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,650
I thought you cared
about patients.

FOREMAN: Our job isn't
to make sure he can bounce
his grandkids on his lap.

Our job is to get him
healthy enough to go back
to death row.

254
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,190
Our job is to diagnose him.

What?

Mommy and Daddy are having
a little fight, doesn't mean
we've stopped loving you.

Now, go outside and play.

258

00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:00,493
That was impressive. Okay,
what number am I thinking of?

261
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,090
Are you trying
to get me fired?

262
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,068
If you didn't want me
working here,
why didn't you just say so?

263
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,799
I just don't want you
working right here,
in my office.

264
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,738
But anywhere else
in the building is fine.
Oh.

265
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:10,797
It's a really big hospital.

266
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,572
I'm a lawyer, you're a jerk.
There's gonna be some overlap.

267

God, I hope
that was a euphemism.

00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,641
Cuddy just reamed me!

269
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,307
I hope that one means
what I think it means.

270
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,476
For trusting you.

271
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,644
She figured when she hired me
she'd at least have someone

you couldn't walk all over.

273
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,152
The number was six,
by the way.

274
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,991
I need to know,
can I trust you?

275
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:35,500
If I hadn't lied to you
about Cuddy's approval,
my patient would be dead.

276
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,762
Great.

277
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,603
Now I know.

278
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,131
Now we can work together.

279

I'll be drawing some blood
from your femoral artery.

From my what?
Runs through your groin.

00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,112
You think
you're gonna stick me
in the jewels with that?

282
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,749
It's really closer
to your thigh. Technically
at this point, it seems like

283
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,952
your jewels are more
for display purposes anyway.

284

Hold up, hold up.
Gimme some painkillers
or something.

don't need them.
Forget that, numb me up, man.

You got some gang ink?
Let me see that.

It means "the force of life."

all these white dudes
so they let you play doctor.

Yup, got them all fooled.

like you go from gang banging
to wearing that white coat?

How's a brother like you
go from loving a woman
to punching her skull in?

Sorry about that.
Guess I didn't use
enough lidocaine.

295
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:58,349
Blood gas came back
with a pH of 7.28,
and decreased HCO-3.

296
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,282
Which means two things.

297
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,844
Most importantly,
Cameron was wrong
about the bi-carb.

298
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,891
And less significantly,
we have a new symptom.

00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,490
Anion gap acidosis.

00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:15,628
Who's chubby? Come on,
pretend he loves puppies.

Pretend he's a human being.
What do you got?

302
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,295
I think we should
reconsider drugs.

303
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,274
He already tested negative.
That's why I said reconsider.

304
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,743
Back in juvie, I cut up
oregano and sold it as pot.

Is that how you put yourself
through med school?

306
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,344
What if Clarence thought
he was taking heroin,
but it was something else?

307
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,682
What "something else"
could lead
to anion gap acidosis?

308
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,311
Mudpiles.

309
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,516
Well, you don't have to ask,
just wash your hands
before you come back.

Drugs for tuberculosis.

Nearly a quarter
of the prison population
is infected with TB.

Clever entrepreneur like
Foreman here chops up his
meds, passes it off as heroin.

317

INH poisoning would explain
all the symptoms.

Who wants to head over
to the prison and find
Clarence's secret stash?

Fine, I'll do it.
Great! Chase it is.

beyond wanting to make me
completely miserable.

will open up to you.

I'll come out
looking just as monstrous.

I mean,
isn't that what I deserve?

Dr. VlVlAN: John,
it wasn't your fault.

326
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:33,711
If your father hadn't
slipped you those drugs,
you would have never done...

He didn't mind. I asked.

498
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,556
I need a segmental
bronchoalveolar lavage.

499
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,723
I take it the CT
with contrast came back?

500
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,597
They're not definitive.
Biopsy would be.

501
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,697
Biopsy would be
invasive and unnecessary.

502
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:01,932
And definitive.

503
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,600
But you don't want definitive,
you want to hang onto
your delusions

504
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,700
as long as you can.

505
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,745
A lavage could prove
it's not cancer.

506
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:11,441
But you need me
to approve the procedure.
Must be a bitch.

507
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,918
The answer is no.
Why?

508
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,646

What is it?

513
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,902
You won't help Cindy,
but you're obsessed
with this piece of dirt!

514
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,404
Are you just trying to prove
that who someone
is doesn't matter,

515
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,373
or that all that matters
is your stupid puzzle?

516
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,472
Fine.

that's all I'm asking.

00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,750
Wow.

520
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,820
That is remarkable.

According to those patchouli
oil-selling New Agers,

522
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,732
it's supposed to be
the terminal patient,

523
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,894
but you're going through
the five stages.

524
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,502
You just made
a completely seamless
transition from anger

525
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,130
to bargaining.

526
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,643
Cover two more
of my clinic hours,

527
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,572
and you can have
your one procedure.

528
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,686
No lesions, no aneurysms.

529
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:32,187
Ironically,
the mind of a killer
looks completely normal.

530
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,824
If someone asked you
to describe me to them,

531
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,596
what's the first thing
you'd tell them?

532
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:39,998

on a blind date.

535

Would you describe me
to the girl as the black guy?
A neurologist?

536
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,213

getting to you, isn't he?

538

guy's still here.

Yeah, sorry. I've just gotta
get him stabilized.

542

for a few more hours,
then off he goes.

'Cause I'm figuring that
you still think he's sick.

544

reasoning. I'm figuring
that you did no figuring.

right? So much for
attorney-client privilege.

Stacy has a duty
to this hospital.

00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,511
Right.
I'm sending him
back to prison.

Court order says he has to be
declared healthy.

582
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,788
Jealousy.

of the adrenal gland,

00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,901
Big baby.

666
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,529
Still don't see anything.

667
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:38,866
(CLARENCE GROANlNG)

668
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,342
CLARENCE: Turn it off!

669
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,535
There's Waldo.

670
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,510
Found it, Clarence.

671
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,048
Turn it off!

672
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:49,149
Turn this damn thing off!

673
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,212
Keep him in there
until you guys see it, too.

674
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,281
Son of a bitch.

675
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:06,228
Looks like they got
the pheo out successfully.

676
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,061
So, what now?

677
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,069
Clarence goes back
to death row.

678
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,667
Just like that?

679
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,476
He's cured.

680
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,113
That tumor caused
random shots of adrenalin,

681
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,641
which obviously led
to the rage attacks that
made him become a murderer

682
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,278
in the first place.

683
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:25,980
My God, you're right!

684
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,581
Let's call the surgeons,
we gotta save that tumor.

685
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,887
Put it on the witness stand.

686
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,588
We could testify
at Clarence's appeal.

687
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:37,093
You smell that?
I think that is the stink
of hypocrisy.

688
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,370
You wouldn't even consider
the notion that Clarence's
social upbringing

689
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,874
was responsible for what
he became, but now you're
sprinting to the witness stand

690
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,499
to blame everything
on a little tumor.

691
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:48,306
A person's upbringing
and their biology
are completely different.

692
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,403
Yeah.

693
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,375
Because you only
overcame one of them.

694
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,452
Well, let's just
give Clarence a free pass.

695
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,279
Which is probably
gonna piss off all those
other pheo sufferers

696
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,188
who managed to control
their rage attacks

697
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:05,751
and become lawyers,
race car drivers,
or even doctors.

698
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:10,327
Removing that tumor
puts a stop to those
random shots of adrenalin.

699
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,601
It doesn't absolve him.

700
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,331
You want him to be executed?

701
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,667
That's not what I'm saying.

702
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,134
Got an opinion?

703
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,004
Everyone's got an opinion.

704
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:34,289
I... I think I'm gonna testify
at Clarence's appeal.

705
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,927
You'll do
what you think is right.

706
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,656
On your own time.

707
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,108
But it's just a cough.

9999
